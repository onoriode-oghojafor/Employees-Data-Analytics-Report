## INTRODUCTION
This report explores potential insights that can be derived from the Employees Data Set. The data set includes columns such as employee ID, full name, job title, department, business unit, ethnicity, age, hire date, annual salary, bonus, country, city, and exit date. By analyzing this data, we can gain valuable insights into the workforce and identify areas for improvement.

## PROBLEM STATEMENT
The high cost of employee turnover is a major challenge for many organizations. To improve retention rates and build a stable workforce, it is important to understand the factors that contribute to employee turnover. This report will use a sample Employee data set to identify potential areas of focus for HR and management teams to address these challenges.

## OBJECTIVES
This project seeks to address these challenges by creating a user-friendly employee dashboard, leveraging advanced data analytics and visualization tools. The Dashboard aims to provide insights into Gender distribution, Annual salary, Average bonus by department, and Numbers of employees by department, fostering informed decision-making and propelling towards sustainable growth. The entirety of this project will be done using Microsoft Excel.

## THE DATA
The data set for this project contains 1000 entries, and 15 columns. Key columns include employee ID (EEID), full name, job title, department, business unit, gender,
ethnicity, age, hire date, annual salary, bonus percentage, country, city, and exit date. All columns are fully populated except for the Exit Date which has 915 missing values. The employee ID (EEID) column contains 89 duplicate values.

DATA CLEANING AND PREPARATION
Once I downloaded and imported the data into Excel, I proceeded to clean and prepare it for analysis. Firstly, I created a new version of my data in case I needed
to drop some columns or make other changes. In the newly created worksheet, the following steps were taken:
● Duplicate Check: I performed data validation to ensure all rows in the dataset met the required criteria.
● Missing Values: The data cleaning identified 915 missing values in the exit column which represents the active number of employees and 85 resigned/retrenched due to some internal factors.
● Data types: All columns were in the general format which is fine for what I need to do.
● Categorical variables: I examined the categorical variables for errors in spelling and other unexpected values. Again, everything was fine.
● Additional Column: I added another column which is the age group and employment status.


## DATA EXPLORATION
With the data now clean and prepared, it was time for exploration and analysis. Now it is time to plot the pivot table to create a visual on various insights derived from the employees' data set, as such, the following insights were derived:

- The Average Age of Employees was 44.<br>
- The Total Number of Employees in Each Department was 1000.<br>
- Amongst the total number of employees, 766 are middle-aged(30-59), 121 are Young adults(<29) and 113 are Old-aged(>=60).<br>
- The department with the Highest Bonus was Marketing.<br>
- We have Gender Distribution in Male as 482, while Female as 518.<br>
- The Exit Date Column shows 915 active employees.<br>
- Amongst the Exited employees, 70 were from the middle-aged group, 3 from the old-aged and 12 from the young adult group.<br> 
- The Annual Average Salary was $113,217.<br>
- The department with the Highest Number of Employees was the IT Department.

## Recommendation
Following a comprehensive analysis of the employee data set, the following recommendations are proposed to enhance the performance and growth of the
Employees. <br>
● Employee Turnover: For departments with high turnover, interviews can be done to gather feedback on why employees are leaving, or recommend improvements to work-life balance, compensation, or management practices.<br>
● Compensation Analysis: If there is an identified pay gap, then a salary adjustment or a review of compensation practices to ensure fairness.<br>
● Training and Development Programs: Analyzing employee training records and performance evaluations can help identify areas for improvement in training and development programs. Tailoring training initiatives to address specific skill gaps can enhance employee performance and job satisfaction.<br>
● Succession Planning: Reviewing employee demographics, tenure, and performance data can aid in succession planning. Identifying high-potential employees and developing succession plans for key roles can ensure continuity and leadership development within the organization.<br>
● Employee Engagement Surveys: Regularly conduct employee engagement surveys to gauge satisfaction, collect feedback, and identify areas for improvement. This data can be invaluable in shaping HR policies and ensuring that they align with employee expectations and needs.<br>
